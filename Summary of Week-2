Week 2 Report

New fetures:
1. Complete the encryption and decryption method.
2. Setup the server and database.
3. Add rest API for server, haven't tested yet.

Summary Report:
The encryption and decrption function can be found in EnigmaLib folder. Small 
changes or modifications may apply in future if needed.(We use RSA to encrpt 
the AES key and we use AES-256 to encrpt the message.)

EnigmaServer folder contains the database(user, group, message, etc.) and the
server we will use for our chat program. New fetures are still being added constantly,
will have more in future.

EnigmaTest is what we use for testing.(Encrption test, decrption test, etc.)

*EnigmaClient is still undergoing, we will mainly focus on this part in our next phase.

Our project will focus on the direction of security. Our main purpose is to build a 
secure chat program. (trying to reach perfect secrecy)
